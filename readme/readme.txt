plugin for CudaText.
supports building Code Tree for WikidPad lexer. standard WikidPad lexer cannot make Code Tree ok, it lists all headers in the same tree level, while this plugin makes nested nodes in the tree. it considers code-blocks (<<...>>), which have lines like headers.

cloned from plugin "Markdown Code Tree".
